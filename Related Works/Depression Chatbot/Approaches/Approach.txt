Artificial neural networks are models that are being computed and are inspired by the idea of the structure of the human brain to solve perplex problems. [1] Those problems would involve some specific tasks like clustering, classification, pattern recognition, and many more. [2] Artificial neural networks also contain a series of layers of nodes (input, hidden, and output) that compute and function as nonlinear summing devices. These nodes have numerous interconnections by having weight in each connection, and these weights are adjusted when the gathered data is to be fed to the network at the process of training. [3] The values of the weights are randomly assigned and are changed during the training process in relation to the output. [1]

In a related study that uses artificial intelligence in discriminating unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders, artificial neural network was used for the diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of psychiatric and neurological diseases. Raw electroencephalography data were used from the 89 subjects as inputs to feed the neural network. Moreover, in the use of particle swarm optimization for the feature selection, it increased the classification accuracy of their PSO-ANN hybrid model with a result of an overall accuracy of 89.89%. Before and after feature selection had classification accuracies from 64.52% to 83.87% for bipolar disorder subjects and from 77.59% to 93.10% for unipolar disorder subjects. By this, the researchers for this study concluded that their findings from this experiment has the potential to be used as a clinical tool in classifying unipolar disorders and bipolar disorders. [4] 

There is also another study that uses artificial neural networks imbued with intelligence based on the natural communication and emotional state of the user. The approach in their study was using chatbots for social therapy in youth mental health. This study will further be discussed in the following sub-section.
