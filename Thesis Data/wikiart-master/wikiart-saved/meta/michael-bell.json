Bell’s narrative strategy is for the viewer to question how much of Ticket to Ride is just a dream, and how much is rooted in reality. Its major movement is the journey taken by an Italian Femme Fetale that begins on a New York City subway platform in Scene 1, \"The Transfer\" as she awaits her metaphorical “train” and her journey continues -- painting by painting -- like a roller coaster ride through her mind.",
