        "description": "Several of Caulfield’s paintings of 1963–4 make direct reference to compositional devices found in the carefully constructed still lifes of the Cubist painter Juan Gris. As Caulfield said ‘What I like about Juan Gris’s work is not that he’s dealing with different view points, it’s the way he does it. It’s very strong, formally, and decorative’.\r\n\r\nDuring this period Caulfield started to introduce exotic objects into his paintings. The art critic Marco Livingstone has described them as combining ‘decorative opulence with technical austerity’. The dagger and sheath here were drawn from life in the Victoria and Albert Museum.",

Her arms are raised in a gesture \r\nof horror and helplessness as she surveys the scene of mass suicide of her patriots who chose \r\ndeath rather than surrender to the Turks.  The painting commemorates the people of \r\nMissolonghi and is symbolic of freedom against tyrannical rule. \r\n\r\nCaulfield deliberately chose to work from a black and white reproduction of the Delacroix \r\npainting so that the colours would be left to his imagination. He used a limited range of \r\nhousehold gloss paints, substituting flat areas of colour for Delacroix’s more emotive \r\nbrushstrokes. ",

Thus those near the bottom of the image are painted as though seen from a point somewhere above, those near the centre appear to be viewed from eye level and those towards the top of the canvas are shown from below. This device emphasises the overall effect of the stacking up of a large number of similar objects. The simple black outlines and strong colours are characteristic of much of Caulfield's work. The artist has written of this painting that it 'was an excuse for me to use a lot of colour'.",

In this case, what appears to be a photomural of the Château de Chillon hanging in a restaurant is depicted with high-focus realism, contrasting with the cartoon-like black-outlined imagery and fields of saturated colour of its surroundings. Caulfield deliberately makes the relationship between these varying representational methods uneasy and ambiguous, so that the picture appears more real than the everyday world around it.",

        "description": "In 'Still life: Autumn fashion' Caulfield skilfully layers pictorial elements, combining schematic techniques with real textures. The leeks, oysters and vessels of the painting are arranged in a disparate way to enable us to find our way into the picture. The play between the two worlds of reality and decoration is further intensified by Caulfield's treatment of two of the oysters in their real texture rather than in a graphic manner. Caulfield has always being interested in transforming ordinary things into extraordinary ones, perhaps suggesting that the role of the modern artist is to make people see and examine things in a different light. As he has noted: \"what we call inspiration results from a careful sifting of everyday experience.\"\r\n\r\nCaulfield became interested in still lifes when he realised that they offered him the opportunity to depict objects true to scale; Caulfield has always enjoyed the one to one relationship with his chosen subjects. In the early 1980s he turned further still towards producing images of food and drink, presenting them with equal weight within his paintings.\r\n\r\nThe layering of elements in 'Still life: Autumn fashion' gives the work an extraordinary mystery and intensity. Although Caulfield's art is enjoyable for its economy of means and lush colours, the ambivalence of the space can often mean that spectators feel they are staring into the void. One is confronted with multiple systems that seem to interfere and interact with each other. Unable to define a spatial position in relation to these objects and conventions, the viewer experiences the picture as if from within the compostition.\r\n\r\n'Still life: Autumn fashion' was bought by the Walker in 1979 with the aid of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation's Regional Purchase Scheme and a grant from the Victoria and Albert Museum.",

        "description": "This large oil painting shows a domestic interior. But instead of choosing a traditional view of a sitting room, bedroom or dining room, Caulfield has focussed on a confined area that is the junction between a landing and two corridors.\r\n\r\nAll the elements are perspectivally correct, but greatly simplified. The effect is to make the space seem simultaneously real and cartoon-like. Although the distance between the viewer and the furthest point in the scene is perhaps no more than twelve feet, there is nevertheless a strong sense of depth within the picture. This is because the foreground, middle ground and background are strongly delineated by the architecture and divide the canvas into thirds.\r\n\r\nCaulfield's domestic interiors are often lifted directly from 1950s interior decorating magazines and they retain their original aspirational mood. Devoid of narrative, Caulfield nevertheless imbues each canvas with a powerful emotional register by suffusing them with a dominant saturated colour. Frequently melancholic, these interiors are always totally still and without a human presence except maybe for a light left on.\r\n\r\nMany of his interior scenes also play with methods of portraying different forms, combinations and sources of light. He also incorporates trompe d'oeil and photorealistic elements in order to playfully explore the relationship between notions of reality, artifice and illusion. Caulfield was interested in showing how no one method of representation within an artwork can claim to be more or less 'real' than another. ",

        "description": "In a letter dated March 1990 the artist wrote of this painting 'The Blue Posts refers to yet another public house of that name. It is an establishment without any particular distinction or charm, but conveniently close to my London studio. The suggestion of colour and object in the title was appealing in that they are absent from the painting, which, however, still retains a visual association with the place itself. The painting is an analogy of this place constructed from various other sources and memories'. \r\n\r\nDuring the 1980s he had returned to a more stripped-down aesthetic; in this case, the precise disposition of a few identifiable elements transforms an ostensibly abstract picture into one evoking a vivid sense of place.",

        "description": "In the late 1990s the National Gallery, London commissioned twenty-four artists from Europe and North America to produce work in response to the gallery's collection. \"Hemingway Never Ate Here\", which was Patrick Caulfield's contribution to the exhibition, takes as its central motif A Cup of Water and a Rose on a Silver Plate, c.1630 (National Gallery, London) by the Spanish seventeenth century painter Francisco de Zurbarán (1598-1664). The motif reappears in Zurbarán's Still Life with Basket of Oranges, 1633 (The Norton Simon Foundation, Pasadena). Though Caulfield had always admired the Spanish still life paintings in the National Gallery, his choice was partly determined by his wish to celebrate his son's recent marriage to a Spaniard.\r\nWhile it is probable that Zurbarán considered the simple composition of his still life paintings as an expression of divine order and that the objects in them have religious significance (clear water and the rose are both symbols associated with the purity and holiness of the Virgin Mary), Caulfield has stated that his primary interest in this painting lies in its formal simplicity, and not in its Christian undercurrents. Although he has meticulously rendered the cup of water and the silver plate as they appear in Zurbarán's painting, the flower has been replaced by a segment of lime. To the right he intended to paint a designer beer with a lime wedge in its neck, but chose a tonic bottle because it was shorter and thus would not break the line of the dado rail above. Since the late 1980s the practice of inserting lime wedges into beer bottles has often come to serve as a fashionable mark of Hispanic culture.\r\nThe bull's head, painted from an actual stuffed head that Caulfield hired in London, was included after he visited a bar off the Plaza Mayor in Madrid in 1998 where a similar one was hung. During the same trip he discovered a bar bearing the inscription 'Hemingway never ate here', a wry recommendation in a city dotted with bars claiming to have served the famous American writer. Ernest Hemingway's evocations of Spain in such books as Fiesta contributed to a national stereotype characterised by noble matadors and hard drinking.\r\nCaulfield's play with signs of cultural identity is matched by his use of pictorial conventions. The high realism evident in the rendering of the bull's head and the still life objects is juxtaposed with a heavily reductive and flat background. While the realist elements command stable spatial positions, the rest of the interior is ambiguous spatially. The relation of the round table with the still life objects to the wall behind is difficult to establish, as is the means by which the table is supported. Likewise how the room through the archway connects with the foreground is not resolved. In the upper left a scroll made from a length of sash cord has been applied to the canvas surface and painted green. As with Interior with a Picture, 1985-6 (Tate T07112) where an oval motif is formed from three thick lines of acrylic paint squeezed direct from the tube, Caulfield points out the artifice of pictorial space by introducing a real three-dimensional object into the painting. The exploration of real and artificial is a central theme in his investigation into painting and culture.",

        "description": "Patrick Caulfield, a painter and printmaker since the 1960s, shares Pop art's detached and ironic view of the world in his pictures, which mix vivid, everyday scenes with bold designs. The Tate has built up a broad collection of his graphic work. This new screenprint is a play on Picasso's famously confrontational painting depicting prostitutes, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, which marked the beginning of Cubism. Caulfield has reversed Picasso's image so that instead of viewing the women frontally, we peer at them from behind. The reversal of this image is both a visual pun on the printing process, which reverses the original design, and a verbal pun on the French word derrière, which means rear end.",
